## About
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This work is based on my summer internship at IIT Delhi in 2015. The project derives its base from the machine learning and data mining framework called <a href="http://vegas.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/index.html">windML</a>. The windML framework provides various tools for machine learning based analysis of real-time wind energy time series data. This project further develops this framework to implement a Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) based system to improve upon the already available spatio-temporal regression models for accurate wind power forecasting. The project is implemented in python using <a href="http://vegas.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/index.html">windML</a>, and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org">Sklearn</a> python libraries.</p>
